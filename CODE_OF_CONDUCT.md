# Code of Conduct 🎮

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of fair play and good sportsmanship, we as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in Ship It Arcade and its community a harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Whether you're a speedrunner or a casual player, a seasoned developer or a first-time contributor — you belong here.

## Our Standards

**Be a good sport! 🏅** Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive community:

- Being welcoming, kind, and encouraging to other players and contributors
- Celebrating others' high scores and achievements
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and respect toward other community members

**Don't be that player. 🚫** Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- **Toxicity and harassment** — No trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- **Hate speech** — Zero tolerance for discriminatory language or behavior of any kind
- **Spam and self-promotion** — Don't flood issues, discussions, or PRs with unrelated content or promotions
- **Cheating** — Submitting fake scores, exploiting bugs for leaderboard advantage, or encouraging others to cheat
- **Doxxing** — Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- **Inappropriate content** — No sexual language, imagery, or unwelcome advances

## Enforcement

Community moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They may:

- **Edit or remove** comments, issues, commits, code, wiki edits, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct
- **Warn** community members engaging in inappropriate behavior
- **Temporarily or permanently ban** anyone whose behavior is deemed harmful, threatening, or repeatedly in violation of these standards

All moderation decisions are made in the interest of keeping this community safe, welcoming, and fun for everyone.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces associated with Ship It Arcade, including:

- GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions
- Score submissions and leaderboard interactions
- Any other forums or channels where the community gathers

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers directly. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with a gaming twist. Because even in arcade games, we play by the rules. 🕹️
