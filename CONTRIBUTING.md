# Contributing to Ship It Arcade 🎮

Thanks for wanting to contribute to Ship It Arcade! Whether you're submitting a high score, reporting a bug, or adding a new feature — we're glad you're here.

## 🏆 Submitting a High Score

Got an impressive score? We want to see it!

1. Open a new issue using the **[Submit High Score](https://github.com/ashleywolf/ship-it-arcade/issues/new?template=submit-score.yml)** template
2. Enter your score and attach a screenshot if you can
3. Share any strategy tips for the community

**⚠️ No cheating!** Scores must be earned through legitimate gameplay. Modified scores, browser console tricks, or tampered submissions will be removed. Play fair — it's more fun that way!

## ✨ Feature Requests

Have an idea to make the game better? We'd love to hear it!

- Open an issue using the **[Feature Request](https://github.com/ashleywolf/ship-it-arcade/issues/new?template=feature-request.yml)** template
- Describe your idea and what category it falls under (Gameplay, Visuals, Audio, etc.)

## 🐛 Bug Reports

Found a bug in the game (not the in-game kind)? Let us know!

- Open an issue using the **[Bug Report](https://github.com/ashleywolf/ship-it-arcade/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml)** template
- Include what happened, what you expected, and your browser/device info
